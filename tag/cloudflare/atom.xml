With some legwork Ian figured out how to markedly reduce the load time for his site by hosting his DNS with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>. What follows are the steps I took to understand the issue and make the switch to CloudFlare. I’d like to give a big thanks to Ian for his initial efforts.</p>

<h2>What’s the Issue?</h2>

<p>Within his first email, Ian included a link to <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/140329_D9_NZT/1/details/">test results for davidensinger.com from Webpagetest.org</a>.</p>

<p>A quick look reveals <strong>a three second delay</strong> in loading the site, which manifests itself in the <strong>Initial Connection</strong> time, of the second request:</p>

<p>An extended look at the first request reveals our culprit, which is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302">302 redirect</a>. We can also verify this via the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug">Facebook Open Graph Debugger</a>:</p>

<h2>302 Redirects</h2>

<p>After a quick search, I found <a href="http://helloanselm.com/2014/github-pages-redirect-performance/">Analyzing the GitHub Pages Waterfall Chart</a>, wherein <a href="https://twitter.com/helloanselm">@helloanselm</a> discovers that <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> intentionally redirects sites that are setup with DNS <code>A</code> records.</p>

<p>This is our exact setup since <a href="http://www.namecheap.com/?aff=32887">Namecheap</a> doesn’t support the <code>ALIAS</code> record, which is suggested by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages">Setting up a custom domain with Pages</a>. For more info see my previous post on <a href="http://davidensinger.com/2013/03/setting-the-dns-for-github-pages-on-namecheap/">Setting the DNS for GitHub Pages on Namecheap</a>.</p>

<p>That said, the <code>ALIAS</code> record doesn’t have robust support amongst registrars. I don’t have a good technical understanding of DNS, so I defer to the following post for a better explanation of the potential pitfalls of the <code>ALIAS</code> record.</p>

<h2>CloudFlare to the Rescue</h2>

<p>Through his research, Ian came across <a href="http://www.higherorderheroku.com/articles/cloudflare-dns-heroku/">a post at Higher Order Heroku</a> that subsequently led him to CloudFlare. It seems that a common request amongst users was for an Alias-type record to use with AWS, Heroku, and GitHub Pages. In response, CloudFlare rolled out CNAME Flattening earlier this year, which they introduced with this blog post: <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root">Introducing CNAME Flattening</a>.</p>

<p>As previously stated, I don’t understand the DNS specification as well as I’d like, but CloudFlare seems confident that their new CNAME Flattening feature won’t break the Internet. It also won’t interfere with your <code>MX</code> records, so you need not worry about receiving your emails either. Ask Ian, as I questioned him on this point several times: “Hey still no email problems?”, to which his reply was always in the affirmative.</p>

<h2>CloudFlare DNS Settings for GitHub Pages</h2>

<p>Okay so you’re ready to make the move to CloudFlare, right? After you sign up (you can do the free account), you’ll then want to add your site:</p>

<p><img src="http://davidensinger.com/assets/img/posts/2014-04-19-cloudflare-add-site.png" alt="Image of CloudFlare Add Site" class="media-center"/></p>

<p>Once CloudFlare finishes importing your DNS records, you’ll then want to delete both of your <code>A</code> records and replace them with one <code>CNAME</code> that points to your <strong>username.github.io</strong>. Use the <strong>@</strong> symbol to denote your root domain:</p>

<p><img src="http://davidensinger.com/assets/img/posts/2014-04-19-cloudflare-cname-for-github-pages.png" alt="Image of CloudFlare CNAME settings for GitHub Pages" class="media-center"/></p>

<p>You should then have the following two <code>CNAME</code> records, amongst whatever other DNS records you may have:</p>

<p>Once you’ve finished modifying your DNS records with CloudFlare, you’ll want to transfer your DNS away from Namecheap.</p>

<h2>Transfering DNS from Namecheap to CloudFlare</h2>

<p>To transfer your DNS to CloudFlare, login to your Namecheap account, select the appropriate domain name, and then go to <strong>Transfer DNS to Webhost</strong>. You’ll see the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="http://davidensinger.com/assets/img/posts/2014-04-19-namecheap-transfer-dns.png" alt="Image of transferring DNS from Namecheap to CloudFlare" class="media-center"/></p>

<p>Please note that the nameservers that I used, <strong>gail.ns.cloudflare.com</strong> and <strong>hugh.ns.cloudflare.com</strong>, may not be the nameservers that you’ll need to use with CloudFlare.</p>

<h2>So Did It Work?</h2>

<p>After a few days with the new DNS settings at CloudFlare, I’m happy to report that the site loads much faster. The 302 redirect is gone, which reduces the <strong>Initial Connection</strong> time and subsequently the <strong>Time to First Byte</strong>:</p>

<p>I’m pleased with the new results, although I’m unsure how this affects the site from the perspective of GitHub Pages. I know they offer <a href="https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages">protection against denial of service attacks</a>, but I don’t know if adding CloudFlare into the mix affects this in any way. If anybody has any perspective on this, please <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidEnsinger">let me know</a>.</p>
