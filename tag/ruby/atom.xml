To that end I made the switch from <strong>WordPress to Jekyll</strong>, which is ”a simple, blog aware, static site generator.” Although Jekyll is easy to maintain, it can be confusing to set up. Thankfully, there is a wealth of documentation available from developers who have also made the switch. With that in mind, I’d like to contribute my experience with installing <strong>Jekyll on OS X</strong>.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>The consensus on the internet is to first install <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a>, which is available from the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&amp;mt=12">App Store</a>. It will take a bit of time to download and install.</p>

<p>Once you’ve installed Xcode, the next step is to install <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/">Command Line Tools</a>, which is available via the command line (naturally). Open up <strong>Terminal</strong> (or <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm2</a>) and enter the following:</p>

<pre><code>xcode-select --install
</code></pre>

<p>After installing the Command Line Tools, install <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, which is the missing package manager for OS X:</p>

<pre><code>ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is to install <a href="https://rvm.io">RVM</a> to help manage different versions of Ruby (although you won’t necessarily need to switch between versions):</p>

<pre><code>\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
</code></pre>

<p>I had some difficulty installing Ruby from RVM, due to some missing dependencies. To fix this I had to find the missing packages:</p>

<pre><code>rvm requirements
</code></pre>

<p>Which then necessitated running the following:</p>

<pre><code>brew doctor
</code></pre>

<p>That led to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10343834/homebrew-wants-me-to-amend-my-path-no-clue-how">a fix for a warning about my paths</a>.</p>

<p>After sorting that out, I was then able to install the list of missing dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>brew install (and then the list of missing packages)
</code></pre>

<p>And then I was able to install Ruby 2.1.1:</p>

<pre><code>rvm install 2.1.1
</code></pre>

<p>Which finally allowed me <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">to install Jekyll</a>:</p>

<pre><code>gem install jekyll
</code></pre>

<h2>Whew!</h2>

<p>That wasn’t so bad, was it? It feels good to work through the install with the satisfaction of knowing that you did it without any help, save for the goodwill efforts of fellow developers and their documentation. High fives to that!</p>
